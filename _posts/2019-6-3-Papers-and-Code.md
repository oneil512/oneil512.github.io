title: Papers and Code
---
A list of papers I have implemented in various ML frameworks.  The goal is to learn as much as possible implementing papers until I know enough to do my own research.

* Long Short-Term Memory &nbsp;[Paper](https://www.bioinf.jku.at/publications/older/2604.pdf) &nbsp;[Code](https://github.com/oneil512/lstm)
* Long Short-Term Memory Networks &nbsp;[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.06733.pdf) &nbsp;[Code](https://github.com/oneil512/lstmn)
* Effective Approaches to Attention-based Neural Machine Translation &nbsp;[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025) &nbsp;[Code](https://github.com/oneil512/Seq2Seq)
* Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes &nbsp;[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6114.pdf) &nbsp;[Code](https://github.com/oneil512/VAE)
* Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks &nbsp;[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf) &nbsp;[Code](https://github.com/oneil512/DCGAN)
